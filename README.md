The main application is written in Django. To run the application install virtualenv, run virtualenv ENV, where ENV is the folder where you want to install the application. Run the virtualenv activate script and install Django 2.1. In the terminal or command shell type django-admin startproject twitter_analyzer. A folder called twitter_analyzer will be created. Download the source code from Github for the twitter_analyzer and place this into the twitter_analyzer folder just created by the Django set up. Navigate to twitter_analyzer (there  will be two folders) and locate the manage.py script. Run python manage.py makemigrations, then python manage.py migrate to create the models in Postgresql or whatever database you choose. Run python manage.py runserver to run the development server. Open a webpage and type localhost:8000/sentiment to open the application webpage. The dataset is not included with the application. If you need test data send Marlo Zeroth (Program0), or jzena001 an email for the data. Finally, you can run the sql scripts to copy the data into postgresql.
